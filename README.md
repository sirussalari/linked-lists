# linked-lists

This assignment is part of the Odin Project curriculum.

This is a simple program written in Ruby that serves the purpose of providing the code for a data structure called the linked list. The linked list is a data structure similar to the array in the sense of both storing indiviudal data points. Although, in arrays, these data points are labeled as elements. In linked lists, these data points are labeled as nodes. The difference lies in the fact that each node points to the next node. This allows for easily being able to insert or remove individual data points.

Beyond just providing the bare bones of the data structure, I also added in some helpful methods to deal with viewing/changing data stored in this structure. In total there are 12 methods that you can use on instances of this data structure.

The methods consist of being able to append new nodes at the end of the list, prepending new nodes at the beginning of the list, being able to view the size of the data structure, being able to view the first node, being able to view the last node, being able to view a node at a given index, being able to remove the last node, being able to check if a value is contained in the list, being able to return the index of a value, being able to insert a value at a defined index, and being able to remove a value at a defined index.
